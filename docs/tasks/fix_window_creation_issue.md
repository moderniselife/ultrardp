# Fix Window Creation Issue in UltraRDP Client

## Task Description
Windows were not opening properly in the UltraRDP client - the application would appear to run but no windows would be visible. While frames were being received from the server properly, they were not being displayed to the user.

## Root Cause Analysis

After extensive testing, I determined that the issue was with the window creation process in the GLFW implementation. The problem wasn't that GLFW itself was failing - a separate test program proved GLFW window creation works fine on the system. Instead, the issues were:

1. **Timing Issues**: Windows were being created too quickly without allowing the windowing system to process events between creations.

2. **Monitor Mismatch**: The client was using its own monitor configuration rather than querying the actual GLFW monitors directly.

3. **Window Positioning**: Windows were being positioned incorrectly, potentially offscreen or stacked on top of each other.

4. **Missing Event Processing**: Insufficient event processing after window creation prevented the windows from being shown properly.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Create a Separate Test Program
First, I created a simple test program that successfully creates windows for all monitors to validate that GLFW window creation works on the system and to identify a reliable pattern:

```go
// In tests/simplified/main.go
func createDisplayWindows() []*glfw.Window {
    // Get monitor info directly from GLFW
    monitors := glfw.GetMonitors()
    
    // Create a window for each real monitor
    windows := make([]*glfw.Window, len(monitors))
    
    for i, monitor := range monitors {
        // Set window hints
        glfw.DefaultWindowHints()
        glfw.WindowHint(glfw.Visible, glfw.True)
        glfw.WindowHint(glfw.Decorated, glfw.True)
        glfw.WindowHint(glfw.Resizable, glfw.False)
        
        // Get monitor position
        x, y := monitor.GetPos()
        mode := monitor.GetVideoMode()
        
        // Create window
        window, err := glfw.CreateWindow(800, 600, "Window Title", nil, nil)
        
        // Position window on the monitor
        window.SetPos(x + (mode.Width - 800) / 2, y + (mode.Height - 600) / 2)
        window.Show()
        
        windows[i] = window
        
        // Process events after each window creation
        glfw.PollEvents()
        
        // Important: Add a short delay between window creations
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
    
    return windows
}
```

### 2. Apply the Working Pattern to the Client

Applied the exact same window creation pattern to the client's display.go file, making sure to:

1. Use the actual GLFW monitors rather than relying on the client's stored configuration
2. Add a delay between window creations to avoid overwhelming the windowing system
3. Position windows based on each monitor's actual position
4. Use consistent window hints
5. Process events between window creations and after all windows are created

```diff
func (c *Client) createWindows() error {	
-    // Initialize windows slice
-    c.windows = make([]*glfw.Window, c.localMonitors.MonitorCount)
+    // Get information about available monitors directly from GLFW
+    monitors := glfw.GetMonitors()
+    
+    // Initialize windows slice based on actual GLFW monitor count
+    c.windows = make([]*glfw.Window, len(monitors))
     
-    // Create one window per monitor
-    for i := uint32(0); i < c.localMonitors.MonitorCount; i++ {
-        monitor := c.localMonitors.Monitors[i]
+    // Create a window for each actual monitor
+    for i, monitor := range monitors {
+        // Set window hints
+        glfw.DefaultWindowHints()
+        glfw.WindowHint(glfw.Visible, glfw.True)
+        glfw.WindowHint(glfw.Decorated, glfw.True)
+        glfw.WindowHint(glfw.Resizable, glfw.False)
+        
+        // Get monitor position
+        x, y := monitor.GetPos()
+        mode := monitor.GetVideoMode()
+        
+        // Create window
         window, err := glfw.CreateWindow(
-            640, 480, 
-            fmt.Sprintf("UltraRDP - Monitor %d", monitor.ID),
+            800, 600,
+            fmt.Sprintf("UltraRDP - Monitor %d", i),
             nil, nil)
         
-        // Position based on monitor position
-        window.SetPos(int(monitor.PositionX), int(monitor.PositionY))
+        // Position window centrally on the monitor
+        window.SetPos(x + (mode.Width - 800) / 2, y + (mode.Height - 600) / 2)
+        
+        // Process events after each window creation
+        glfw.PollEvents()
+        
+        // Critical: Add a delay between window creations
+        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
     }
```

## Testing
The solution was verified to create and display windows properly for each monitor. The key improvements were:

1. **Reliable Window Creation**: Windows now open correctly for all monitors.
2. **Consistent Positioning**: Windows are properly positioned on each monitor.
3. **Event Processing**: Proper event processing ensures windows are shown and updated.
4. **Timing Control**: Delays between window creations avoid overwhelming the windowing system.

## Conclusion
This solution addresses the window creation issues by using patterns proven to work in test environments. The approach ensures that windows are created and displayed properly, allowing the client to correctly show remote desktop content.
