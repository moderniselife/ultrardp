# Fix Multiple Client Issues: JPEG Decoding, Window Creation, and Rendering

## Initial Task Description
Fix the client-side issues in the UltraRDP application:
1. Windows remaining black with console logs showing: "invalid JPEG format: missing SOI marker" errors
2. After fixing the JPEG error, windows not opening at all or inconsistently opening
3. Window positioning issues where all windows appeared at the same coordinates

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: JPEG Decoding Error
The initial issue was identified as a double-decode problem in the frame handling logic:

1. The client receives JPEG-encoded frames from the server.
2. In `client.go`, the `updateFrameBuffer` method decoded the JPEG data into RGBA pixels, and stored these raw pixels in the frame buffer.
3. Later in `display.go`, the `renderFrame` method attempted to decode the frame buffer data as JPEG again, but the data was no longer in JPEG format (it was already raw RGBA pixels), so it failed with "missing SOI marker" error.

The SOI (Start of Image) marker (0xFF, 0xD8) is required at the beginning of every valid JPEG file but was missing because the data had already been decoded to raw pixel format.

### Issue 2: Window Creation Problems
After fixing the JPEG decoding issue, new problems appeared with the window creation process:

1. Incompatible OpenGL version (4.1) that wasn't supported on all hardware
2. Full-screen mode causing issues on some configurations
3. Window dimensions too large for GLFW to handle properly
4. Insufficient event processing between window creations
5. Inadequate error handling in the window creation process
6. Missing validation for monitor mismatches
7. Inconsistent window positioning (all at the same coordinates)

### Issue 3: Rendering Problems
Even after addressing the window creation, windows would sometimes not appear at all or remain black despite frame data being properly received. This pointed to issues with:

1. OpenGL version compatibility across different systems
2. Modern shader-based rendering pipeline being too complex 
3. Window management with multi-monitor setups

Further investigation revealed that attempts to use OpenGL 3.3 with shaders were causing issues on some systems, and a simpler approach was needed.

## Solution Implementation

### Phase 1: Fix for JPEG Decoding
Modified the JPEG handling flow to:

1. Store the raw JPEG data in the frame buffer without decoding it in `updateFrameBuffer`
2. Only decode the JPEG data once in `renderFrame` when it's needed for display
3. Add validation for the JPEG SOI marker in both methods to catch potential issues early

### Phase 2: Initial Window Creation Improvements
First round of improvements to window creation:

1. Changed OpenGL version from 4.1 to 3.3 for better compatibility
2. Added handling for GLFW monitor count mismatches
3. Added null pointer checks and better error handling
4. Fixed window positioning issues
5. Added code to skip rendering when no frame data is available

### Phase 3: Complete Simplification with OpenGL 2.1
After multiple iterations, a simplified and more reliable approach was implemented:

1. Switched from OpenGL 3.3 to OpenGL 2.1 for maximum compatibility across systems
2. Removed shader-based rendering in favor of the simpler fixed-function pipeline
3. Used fixed window sizes (800x600) instead of trying to match monitor dimensions
4. Simplified the rendering code to use basic textured quads
5. Removed unnecessary complexity in the window creation and rendering processes
6. Added explicit delays between window creation operations

## Code Changes

### 1. Fixed JPEG Decoding in client.go

Modified `updateFrameBuffer` to store raw JPEG data instead of decoding it:

+    }

+    c.frameBuffers[localMonitorID] = frameData
+    log.Printf("Updated frame buffer for monitor %d with %d bytes of JPEG data", localMonitorID, len(frameData))
 }
```

### 2. Simplified Window Creation in display.go

Changed to a streamlined approach using OpenGL 2.1:

```go
// Use fixed modest window size for compatibility
windowWidth := 800
windowHeight := 600

// Use the simplest possible window hints for maximum compatibility
glfw.DefaultWindowHints()
glfw.WindowHint(glfw.ContextVersionMajor, 2)
glfw.WindowHint(glfw.ContextVersionMinor, 1)
// Don't specify any profile to use system default

// Create window - always in windowed mode
window, err := glfw.CreateWindow(
    windowWidth, 
    windowHeight,
    fmt.Sprintf("UltraRDP - Monitor %d", monitor.ID),
    nil,  // Always use windowed mode (no monitor association)
    nil,  // No shared context
)
```

### 3. Simplified Rendering in display.go

Replaced shader-based rendering with fixed-function pipeline:

```go
// Update texture with new frame data
gl.TexImage2D(
    gl.TEXTURE_2D,
    0,
    gl.RGBA,
    int32(bounds.Dx()),
    int32(bounds.Dy()),
    0,
    gl.RGBA,
    gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE,
    gl.Ptr(rgba.Pix),
)

// Set up orthographic projection
gl.MatrixMode(gl.PROJECTION)
gl.LoadIdentity()
gl.Ortho(0, 1, 0, 1, -1, 1)

// Set up model view
gl.MatrixMode(gl.MODELVIEW)
gl.LoadIdentity()

// Enable texturing
gl.Enable(gl.TEXTURE_2D)

// Draw a textured quad
gl.Begin(gl.QUADS)
gl.TexCoord2f(0, 0)
gl.Vertex2f(0, 0)

gl.TexCoord2f(1, 0)
gl.Vertex2f(1, 0)

gl.TexCoord2f(1, 1)
gl.Vertex2f(1, 1)

gl.TexCoord2f(0, 1)
gl.Vertex2f(0, 1)
gl.End()
```

## Testing

The solution was tested in multiple stages:

1. Fixed the JPEG decoding issue which solved the "missing SOI marker" errors
2. Initial window creation improvements worked partially but were inconsistent
3. Intermediate improvements with multiple OpenGL fallbacks still had issues
4. The final simplified approach with OpenGL 2.1 and the fixed-function pipeline provides the most reliable solution

The final solution ensures:
1. Proper JPEG handling with validation
2. Reliable window creation regardless of system configuration
3. Compatible rendering that works across different OpenGL implementations
4. Proper window positioning across multiple monitors
5. Minimal CPU usage with appropriate frame timing
