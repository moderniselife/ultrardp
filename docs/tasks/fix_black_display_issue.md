# Fix Black Display Issue in UltraRDP Client

## Task Description
Windows were opening without displaying remote desktop content, resulting in black screens. In some cases, windows were not opening at all.

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the code and documentation, I identified several issues:

1. **Rendering Pipeline Issues**: The code was still using OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile with shaders, which has compatibility issues on some systems. According to the previous fix documentation, it should have been using OpenGL 2.1 with a fixed-function pipeline.

2. **Context Management Problems**: OpenGL contexts weren't being properly managed between windows, leading to black screens or windows not opening.

3. **Synchronization Issues**: There were race conditions in frame buffer management between the network thread receiving frames and the rendering thread.

4. **Window Creation Process**: The window creation process lacked proper error handling and staging.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Improved OpenGL Setup and Rendering
- Changed the OpenGL import from v3.3-core to v2.1
- Modified GLFW window hints to use OpenGL 2.1 instead of 3.3
- Removed modern shader-based rendering in favor of simpler fixed-function pipeline
- Added proper texture configuration with appropriate error handling

 	"github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.3/glfw"
 )
```

### 2. Enhanced Window Creation
- Made window creation more robust with staged approach (create invisible, then show)
- Added additional error handling and validation
- Improved positioning of windows to ensure they appear in the correct places
- Added processing of events between window creation steps to allow the windowing system to catch up

```diff
// Set window creation hints for maximum compatibility
glfw.DefaultWindowHints()
glfw.WindowHint(glfw.ContextVersionMajor, 2)
glfw.WindowHint(glfw.ContextVersionMinor, 1)
+glfw.WindowHint(glfw.Resizable, glfw.False)
+glfw.WindowHint(glfw.Visible, glfw.False)  // Start invisible, show later
```

### 3. Fixed OpenGL Context Management
- Added proper context detachment between operations to prevent driver issues
- Improved context switching between windows
- Added verification of OpenGL initialization success

```diff
// Make context current briefly to verify it works
window.MakeContextCurrent()
if err := gl.Init(); err != nil {
    log.Printf("WARNING: Failed to initialize OpenGL for window %d: %v", i, err)
}
+glfw.DetachCurrentContext() // Release context
```

### 4. Enhanced Synchronization and Error Handling
- Improved mutex handling to prevent deadlocks
- Added proper error recovery for JPEG decode failures
- Added explicit synchronization between network and rendering threads
- Added delays to allow connection establishment before window creation

```diff
// Allow a brief moment for server connection to establish
+time.Sleep(200 * time.Millisecond)
```

### 5. Improved Error Resilience
- Added recover mechanisms for panic situations (like JPEG decode errors)
- Added fallback rendering when frame data is invalid (red screen instead of crash)
- Added comprehensive validation of incoming frames

## Testing
The solution was tested to ensure:
1. Windows now open reliably on system startup
2. Windows display the remote desktop content properly
3. The application handles various error conditions gracefully
4. Multiple monitor configurations are supported correctly

## Additional Notes
This solution follows the approach outlined in the previous fix documentation, using the simpler and more widely compatible OpenGL 2.1 fixed-function pipeline. However, it goes further in addressing window creation and synchronization issues that were causing windows to not appear at all.

The changes maintain compatibility with the existing codebase while improving reliability across different systems and graphics hardware. The solution is now more robust against driver differences and timing issues.
